# Flask-Project-COLLABORATED-
Work in progress. Collaborated with two other students to create a basic web application that authorizes students and instructors access to a "Course Website", primarily designed by collaborating partners.

I have uploaded only files I contributed to, and marked comments on code that was written by the others.
Summary of my part: most of the backend with Flask/python, tiny snippet of html and css.


TODO: add demo video, fix type error (suspect bug is due to python sets).
